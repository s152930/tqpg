<p lang="en-us"><b><u>About TQPG</u></b><br />
We are here to make this special time a bit more copeable for you. So you can stay inside your baby bubble, and find the answers to all your questions and worries here.<br /><br />
<b><u>Mission</b></u><br />
Our mission is to help libraries - book and story-telling paradise for young families - to help one of their most prominent user groups. We know that the amount of information on
(possible) medical conditions, choice of nappies, weaning and baby food, finding reliable childminders, or playgroups and support groups can be quite overwhelming. We know there 
is no end to information. That is why we wanted to build an app where parents can find just what they are looking for, without all the other scary, misleading and fear mongering 
information that can be found on the endless of forums on unrestricted search engines. And if you would like - and you will discover eventually that this is necessary to remain a 
balance in your life so you won't get overwhelmed by this new and all consuming responsibility in your life - you can connect to other parents and share tips and tricks, or set up
a playgroup!<br /><br />
<b><u>Vision</u></b><br />
To spread the power of information and inspire healthier communities by connecting new parents/guardians/childminders to any baby-related answers and local events.<br /><br />
